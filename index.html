	   <p>
		 A driven student with a quick perception, and recognition of problems along with critical thinking skills and analysis. Intrigued by financial markets, models, and derivatives in particular. In addition to strategy development, formulation, and implementation.  With an aspiration to integrate both fields in my future. Beyond business topics, I am highly interested in digital humanitiies, and completed a couple of projects within that domain.
